# CodeAcademy Machine Learning Repository

Welcome to the **CodeAcademy Machine Learning Repository**! This repository contains a comprehensive collection of machine learning techniques, including supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning. Additionally, it covers recommender system feature engineering and MLOps best practices.

## üìå Repository Contents

### 1. Supervised Learning
Supervised learning algorithms rely on labeled data to make predictions. This section includes:
- Linear Regression
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Trees
- Random Forests
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- Neural Networks (NLP)

### 2. Unsupervised Learning
Unsupervised learning techniques find patterns in unlabeled data. This section includes:
- K-Means Clustering
- Hierarchical Clustering
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
- t-SNE
- Autoencoders

### 3. Reinforcement Learning
Reinforcement learning is used to train agents to take optimal actions in an environment. This section includes:
- Q-Learning
- Deep Q Networks (DQN)
- Policy Gradient Methods
- Actor-Critic Methods

### 4. Recommender System 
Feature engineering for recommender systems is crucial for improving recommendations. This section includes:
- Collaborative Filtering (User-Based & Item-Based)
- Matrix Factorization (SVD, ALS)
- Content-Based Filtering
- Hybrid Recommendation Systems

### 5. Feature Engineering
- Feature Engineering Techniques (Embedding, One-Hot Encoding, etc.)
- Filter Method
- Wraper Method
- Sequential Forward Selection (SFS)
- Sequential Backward Selection (SBS)
- Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE)

### 6. MLOps
MLOps practices help in deploying and maintaining machine learning models effectively. This section includes:
- Model Versioning & Experiment Tracking (MLflow, DVC)
- CI/CD Pipelines for ML
- Model Deployment (FastAPI, Flask, Docker, Kubernetes)
- Monitoring & Logging (Prometheus, Grafana)
